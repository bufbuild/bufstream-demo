# Bufstream Demo

## What is Bufstream?

[Bufstream](https://buf.build/product/bufstream) is a drop-in replacement for
Apache Kafka that's 10x cheaper to operate.
While Bufstream works well for any Kafka workload, it excels when paired with
Protobuf.
By integrating with the Buf Schema Registry, Bufstream can enforce data quality
and governance policies without relying on opt-in client configuration.

In this demonstration, you'll run a Bufstream agent locally, use the `franz-go`
library to publish and consume messages, and explore Bufstream's schema
enforcement features.

## Requirements

- Git
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Buf CLI](https://buf.build/docs/installation)
- [Go 1.22+](https://go.dev/doc/install) _[optional, for local development]_

## Getting started

Before starting, perform the following steps to prepare your environment to run
the demo.

1. Clone this repo:

   ```shellsession
   $ git clone https://github.com/bufbuild/bufstream-demo.git
   $ cd bufstream-demo
   ```

1. Start downloading Docker images: _[optional]_

   ```shellsession
   $ docker compose pull
   ```

## Try out Bufstream

The Bufstream demo application simulates a small application that produces and 
consumes `EmailUpdated` event messages. The demo publishes these events to a 
Bufstream topic, followed by a separate consumer that fetches from the same 
topic and "verifies" the change. The demo app uses an off-the-shelf Kafka client
([`franz-go`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go)) to interact with Bufstream.

The demo attempts to publish and consume three payloads:

- A semantically valid, correctly formatted version of the `EmailUpdated` message.
- A correctly formatted, but semantically invalid version of the message.
- A malformed message.

### Replace Apache Kafka

1. Boot up the Bufstream and demo apps:

   ```shellsession
   $ docker compose up --build
   ```

1. The app logs both the publishing of the events on the producer side and
   shortly after, the consumption of these events. The consumer deserializes
   the first two messages correctly, while the final message fails with a
   deserialization error.

At this point, you've used Bufstream as a drop-in replacement for Apache Kafka.

### Data quality enforcement

Thus far, Bufstream hasn't applied any quality enforcement on the data passing
through it &mdash; addresses can be invalid or malformed. To ensure the quality
of data flowing through Bufstream, you can configure policies that require data
to conform to a pre-determined schema, pass semantic validation, and even
redact sensitive information on the fly.

We'll demonstrte this functionality using the Buf Schema Registry, but
Bufstream also works with any registry that implements Confluent's REST API.

1. Uncomment the `data_enforcement` block in [`configs/bufstream.yaml`](configs/bufstream.yaml).

1. Uncomment the `--csr` command options under the `demo` service in [`docker-compose.yaml`](docker-compose.yaml).

1. To pick up the configuration changes, terminate the Docker apps via `ctrl+c` and restart them with `docker compose up`.

1. The app again logs both the attempted publishing and consumption of the 
   three events. The first event will successfully reach the consumer. But
   with Bufstream's data quality enforcement enabled, the second and third
   messages are rejected.

1. For the message that reaches the consumer, notice the empty `old_address` in 
   the logs. This field has been redacted by Bufstream as it's labeled with the 
   `debug_redact` option.

By configuring Bufstream with a few data quality and governance policies,
you've ensured that consumers receive only well-formed, semantically valid
data.

### Cleanup

After completing the demo, you can stop Docker and remove credentials from your
machine with the following commands:

```
docker compose down --rmi all
```
